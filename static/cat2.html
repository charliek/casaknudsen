<br />

One of the biggest surprises we had is the quality of the local golf scene. There are a number of high quality courses within 30 minutes traveling time. Listed here is just a sampling of what's in the neighborhood in order of which is closest.
<br />

<br />
</span><span class="style1"><strong>Golf Club at Playacar</strong></span><span class="bodyCopy"><br />

18 hole par 72 spectacular championship track designed by Robert Von Hagge. Unbelievable condition, winds through the lush mayan jungle with ruins and natural cenotes coming into play on many holes. About 10 minutes away by car or taxi. Costs are a little spendy but include all you can eat and drink afterwords. Plan your day right and the golf is real cheap!
<br />
<br />
<strong>Iberostar Playa Paraiso Golf Club</strong><br />
This new par 72 18 hole course, a PB Dye design, is a very nice course carved out of the Mayan jungle.  While a bit spendy, lunch and drinks at the clubhouse and everything off the beverage cart during the round are included. (a few miles up the coast from Playa - a $15 cab ride)
<br />
<br />
<strong>El Camaleon Mayakoba</strong><br />
This championship Greg Norman design is truly spectacular and senior PGA tour stop.  From Cenotes to holes that play right to the Caribbean, it is spectacular to view and challenging to play. (up the coast toward Cancun 5-10 miles, maybe a $20 cab ride)
<br />
<br />

<strong>Cozumel Country Club</strong><br />

A wonderful Nicklaus design on the neighboring island of Cozumel. A short ferry and cab ride away (45 minutes total)
<br />
<br />
<strong>Mayan Resort Golf Club</strong><br />

Also Nicklaus design, is an 18 hole par 54 course.
<br />

<br />
<strong>Puerto Aventuras</strong><br />

Tom Lehman design 9 holes. Located 20 miles south in Puerto Aventuras.
<br />

<br />
<strong>And Many More... </strong>
<br />

Additionally, there are many more new Championship courses in the area between Playa and  Cancun.<br />

            <br />
The entire Yucatan peninsula is dotted with ruins from the ancient Mayan and other indian civilizations. They are all worth seeing but we'll list them in order of the ones we like and know the best.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tulum</strong><br />
Was once a major seaport for Mayan traders. It is a beautiful location right on the ocean with wonderful vistas and a fair amount of structures. It would be &quot;ruins light&quot; for those interested in ruins but not wanting to be fanatical about it. An easy 50-60 mile drive south on a major highway. (the area between Tulum and Playa is the focus of much new development so you may even find a nice place to have lunch afterwords) Also near Xel Ha a beautiful natural water park for tubing and snorkeling...<br />
<br />
<strong>Chichen-Itza</strong><br />
The largest Mayan ruin site in the Yucatan, extensive and spectacular. The location of the famous El Castillo pyramid(91 large steps to the top for those brave enough to venture) a 3 hour drive, take the toll road and make sure you fill up your tank in Playa. <br />
One other notable is Calakmul, 250-300 miles south with 6, structures over 75 sq kilometers almost totally covered by jungle. </span></div></td>

            <br />
The entire coastal area of the Mayan Peninsula is rich with natural underwater splendor including cenotes, cavern diving and reefs with a wide variety of Caribbean sea life. Cozumel, which is a short 1/2 hour ferry ride away is world famous for its snorkeling and diving venues. Many dive shops in Playa to cater to your every whim, dive shops are plentiful on First and Fifth Avenues just a few blocks from the condo. <br />

        <td valign="top"><div id="bodyDiv"><span class="bodyCopy"><strong>BEACHES</strong><br />
<br />
The beaches of Playa del Carmen have been ranked among the top 5 best in the world. Two of the finest beaches in Playa are located just a short block and a half from our condo.<br />
Mamita's Beach Club and Club Kool. <br />
<br />
Both offer palapas (mexican for a big straw umbrella) and beach chairs to rent for approximately $6-10 US per day for two. The sand is white and fine, and the water is clear and beautiful. Both have waiter and food service, the KOOL Beach Club at Kool Beach also features sunning beds (for an additional charge) and a pool. As long as your pesos last, they'll keep bringing margaritas. Depending on the day and the crowd topless sun bathing is quite common. <br /><br />
If you prefer to find a quieter spot on the beach, there are miles to choose from.<br />

        <td valign="top"><div id="bodyDiv"><span class="bodyCopy"><strong>FISHING</strong><br />
            <br />

Starting by saying that we wouldn't know what end of a fishing rod was up, there really is a world of spectacular fishing in the Caribbean waters off Playa. In fact until a decade or so ago, Playa del Carmen was a small fishing village known only to the world's serious anglers.<br />
<br />
The "pangas" or small fishing boats are for hire and will pick you up right on the beach in Playa. The channel between Cozumel and Playa is a "gamefish highway" the big fish run so close to shore, you'll have to start baiting your hook before you open a beer. While the "pangas" will leave from Playa, the larger boats leave from Puerta Aventuras just 20 or so miles south. It is advisable to book a boat before you leave, especially during peak seasons. The types of fish you may encounter:
Sailfish, Dorado, Blue Marlin, White Marlin, Barracuda, Wahoo, Tuna and Reef fish (snapper, jack, grouper etc)
<br />
